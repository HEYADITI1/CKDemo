1. What is the Java Collections Framework? Explain its advantages.

The Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a set of classes and interfaces in java.util package that provides ready-to-use data structures (like lists, sets, maps, and queues) and algorithms (like sorting and searching).

It allows developers to store, manipulate, and retrieve data efficiently.

Advantages:

Reusability: Provides standard, reusable data structures — no need to implement them manually.

Performance: Optimized implementations of algorithms and data structures.









2. List the differences between Vector, ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashSet.

1. Vector

->Vector is a legacy class introduced before Java Collections Framework.

->It uses a dynamic array to store elements.

->Maintains insertion order of elements.

->Allows duplicates.

2. ArrayList

->ArrayList is part of the Java Collections Framework.

->It also uses a dynamic array internally.

->Maintains insertion order and allows duplicate elements.

->It is not synchronized, so it is faster but not thread-safe.

->Provides fast random access (via index-based access).

3. LinkedList

->LinkedList is implemented using a doubly linked list structure.

->Maintains insertion order and allows duplicates.

->Not synchronized, so not thread-safe.

->Provides faster insertion and deletion compared to ArrayList because no shifting is required.


4. HashSet

->HashSet is part of the Set interface in the Collections Framework.

->It uses a hash table internally for storing elements.

->Does not maintain any order of elements.

->Does not allow duplicates — only unique elements are stored.

->Not synchronized, hence not thread-safe.
